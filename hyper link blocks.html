<h1> blocks in periodictable </h1>
<p>
    A block of the periodic table is a set of elements unified by the atomic orbitals their valence electrons or vacancies lie  in.The term appears to have been first used by Charles Janet.Each block is named after its characteristic orbital: s-block, p-block, d-block, and f-block.
    The block names (s, p, d, and f) are derived from the spectroscopic notation for the value of an electron's azimuthal quantum number.
